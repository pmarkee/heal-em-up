## Rules

You control a plague doctor. Your job is to:
* kill all the evil rats who want to spread the plague by using your Purge power.
* heal all poor souls who already have the plague by using your Heal power.

There are two types of "enemies":
* villagers. They can either be healthy, or plagued. (TODO images here). You have to use your Heal power to cure them. However, if a rat touches them after you already healed them, they will be plagued again! If you accidentally use your Purge power instead of Heal on a villager, you get a penalty to your score, which depends on whether they were plagued or healthy.
* rats: Use your Purge power to kill them. As mentioned, they can infect already healed villagers.

## Controls

* Movement: `w` - up, `s` - down.
* Shoot: `space`.
* Change power: `c`.
